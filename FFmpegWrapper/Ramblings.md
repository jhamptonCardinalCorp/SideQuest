Add Metadata?
Include tags or keywords at the top of each entry for quick searching:
* Tags: #performance #bugfix #feature #integration #experiment #todo
-Could later grep or use VS Code search to find relevant notes quickly.

Use new entries instead of editing old ones to better track train of thought over time.

Link to Code or Commits
Wheneever possible, reference related files or commits:
Related: src/PluginLoader.cs | Commit abc1234 - Added dynamic plugin loading functionality.

Automate Portions
We could create a small script(s) or VS Code snippet that inserts the template automatically when we start a new entry.

Markdown Enhancements to consider:
* Use tables for comparisons
* Use checklists for tasks or to-dos
* Use collapsible sections for lengthy details(if editor supports it)
